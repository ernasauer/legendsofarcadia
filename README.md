## Medusa

"Medusa" is an unnamed generic text based game engine. 

**Note until version 1, the master branch is unstable and is _not_ ready for production**

## Purpose

For years I have been developing text based games, ranging from some of the top browser based games, to little indie games, throughout my time I have yet to come across a sufficient engine.

There are a few things that I required when searching

- Documentation
- Security
- Modular

This framework intends to solve these issues.

Thought there are a few out there such as [MCCodes](http://mccodes.com) they didn't fit my required needs.

---
Medusa is based upon the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework and provides huge flexibility in what a module can do. The core of the framework will be in the current repository, while modules will be in a separate one to be created later on.

**So what can you do with Medusa?**

The hope is that you can build games such as [Torn](http://torn.com), [Omerta](http://barafranca.com), [Sryth](http://www.sryth.com/) or even [Reign of Blood](http://reignofblood.net/).

Though each of those are very different, they all rely on the same core mechanics

**When will be the first release?**

Unknown at this time, we hope to get this going in the next few months, the core still requires a mass amount of work, I want to get the administration side of things to be as automated as possible when generating a new module, but a lot of work left to do.

**What tools/frameworks are used to build Medusa?**

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) as the framework, we use Blade for views
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com) as the front end framework
- [Pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) for loading pages within the game, thanks to [Sergio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sergiovilar/jquery-pjax) for putting it up on NPM.
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) for their awesome icons
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework
